# docs/archive
This folder contains **historical documentation** for deprecated schemas and systems.

Rules:
- Nothing in this folder is used by runtime code.
- Examples here may be invalid for the current app.
- Files here are preserved for reference and migration support only.

Naming convention:
- `*_CJ1.md` = documentation for CJ-1.x era
- `*_GRAPH_1x.md` = documentation for CJ-GRAPH-1.x era

When deprecating a schema:
1) Move old doc into this folder.
2) Add a banner at the top: “Archived — not valid for latest.”
3) Update the current root docs to reflect latest-only.
